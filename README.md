# Four classroom models
This repository contains the 3D models of the case study classrooms used for most of the analyses carried out for my PhD research. 
These specific classrooms were chosen in accordance with the requirements for another PhD research conducted by my colleague 
Nafsika Drosou, that aims at providing evidence that will improve the understanding of how building occupants 
perceive daylight; how they respond to daylight performance due to the building design; and how their needs and actions 
shape the actual daylight performance of classrooms 
([Paper presented at the 6th VELUX Symposium, London 2015](https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/19652)).

The four classrooms differ in size, style and fenestration types. The models are available in SketchUp v2015 and Radiance formats.
Some of the models have more than one version as the accuracy was improved or as more details were added during the study.
